Our exploration of GAN models, including the standard GAN, WGAN, and AC-GAN, using the CIFAR-10 dataset, reveals significant differences in their capability to generate high-quality, diverse images. The standard GAN, while foundational, exhibited limitations in stability and diversity. WGAN addressed these issues through a novel loss function that improved training stability and image quality. The AC-GAN, particularly with our modifications, excelled in producing class-specific, realistic, and diverse images, confirmed by quantitative metrics.

The modified AC-GAN architecture marked a notable advancement in handling class imbalances and enhancing the diversity of generated images. This study has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing GAN performance, such as network design, loss functions, and training strategies.

In conclusion, our analysis contributes to the understanding and optimization of GANs, paving the way for their application in more complex image generation tasks. Future work should aim to enhance computational efficiency and expand the applicability of these models across different domains, continuing to push the boundaries of what generative models can achieve in artificial intelligence.
